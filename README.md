(WIP)

Making an application where users can add their predictions for tournaments and compare them with others. Ideally will have a point system based on accuracy and a leaderboard to view the scores. 

**Current status:**
  - Users can create tournaments 
  - Users can view all created tournaments
  - Users can make predictions on these tournaments which are saved
 
**To be implemented:**
  - Styling (basically 0 effort has been put into styling, doing back end/functionality first)
  - System for checking accuracy of predictions
  - System for adding points depending on accuracy of predictions (Most likely will be lambda which triggers when the tournament results are updated)
  - Leaderboard
